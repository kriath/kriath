# NexusStartPage
Now with backup and restore functionality added!

A simple startpage with CRUD capabilities based on localStorage. It uses Backbone, Jquery and Bootstrap. 

You can see it working in this [link](https://eduardozepeda.github.io/nexusStartPage/)

### Activate localStorage
This site relies on localStorage to store data. Please refer to your browser settings to activate it.

### How to add or modify sections
To add or modify the default sections open the js/sections.js file and modify the following line of code:

```
sections = ['Social', 'Mail', 'Media', 'Shops', 'Programming', 'Blogs', 'Others', 'News', '4chan'];
```

Please feel free to use your own sections:

```
sections = ['Your Section 1', 'Your Section 2', 'Your Section 3', 'Your Section 4', 'Your Section 5', 'Your Section 6'];
```

### Todo
There are a lot of things I would love to improve. Any contribution will be appreciated.

- [ ] Create a better design
- [ ] Add or remove sections directly on the website
